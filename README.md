# Occupcny detection by Bluetooth device tracking

This repository is for explaining the Bluetooth based occupancy detection system using Raspberry Pi.

The repository is structed as follows:
- Individual Presence:
- Crowd Density:

## `Individual Presence` folder
This folder contains blabla: `temporal` or blabla and `meta` or the data is collected from.

## `Crowd Density` folder
blablabla `blablabla` - blablabla (or **blablabla**) as blablabla
